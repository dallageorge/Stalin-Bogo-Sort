# Stalin-Bogo-Sort\n
This is a combination of Stalin sort and Bogo sort. \n
It shuffles the array k times and performs Staling sort on each. \n
The result is gonna be Î©(k*n) and although the algorithm is not complete at sorting it can give a small sorted subset.\n
#Example\n
Output for n=100 k=10:\n
Result Array: [31, 61, 64, 90, 95, 96, 99]Max Length: 7
