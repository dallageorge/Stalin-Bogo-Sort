# Stalin-Bogo-Sort<br>
![Screenshot](image_used_in_readme.jpeg)
This is a combination of Stalin sort and Bogo sort. <br>
It shuffles the array k times and performs Staling sort on each, keeping and finally printing the best result (that with the biggest length). <br>
The result is gonna be Î˜(k*n) and although the algorithm is not complete at sorting it can give a small sorted subset.<br>
#Examples<br>
#Warning the results are all based on luck!<br>
Output for n=100 k=10:<br>
Result Array: [31, 61, 64, 90, 95, 96, 99]<br>Max Length: 7 <br>
<br>
Output for n=100 k=1 (just stalin sort):<br>
Result Array: [91, 92, 97, 99]<br>Max Length: 4<br>
