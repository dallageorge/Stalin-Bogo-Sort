# Stalin-Bogo-Sort<br>
This is a combination of Stalin sort and Bogo sort. <br>
It shuffles the array k times and performs Staling sort on each. <br>
The result is gonna be Î©(k*n) and although the algorithm is not complete at sorting it can give a small sorted subset.<br>
#Example<br>
Output for n=100 k=10:<br>
Result Array: [31, 61, 64, 90, 95, 96, 99]Max Length: 7 <br>
