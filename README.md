# Stalin-Bogo-Sort
This is a combination of Stalin sort and Bogo sort. 
It shuffles the array k times and performs Staling sort on each. 
The result is gonna be Î©(k*n) and although the algorithm is not complete at sorting it can give a small sorted subset.
#Example
Output for n=100 k=10:
Result Array: [31, 61, 64, 90, 95, 96, 99]Max Length: 7
